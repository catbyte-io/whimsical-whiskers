Welcome to Whimsical Whiskers!

# Features
This is the place to view your favorite Warrior Cat characters as they may appear in real life. Choose from the list of characters to view an interpretation of what breed the character might be, breed temperament, and images from the Cat API - all on the server side.

While you are here, you can also find cats near you who need a forever home. Type your zipcode into the search bar to find cats at an adoption center near you. Use the arrows to navigate between cats. This is a client side app that uses the power of the Petfinder API.
